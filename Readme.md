# How to manage appointment's custom fields via the context menu


<p>This example demonstrates how to add an additional menu item that represents a custom field to the default appointment's context menu. To achieve the goal, handle the PopupMenuShowing event of the SchedulerControl.  In this sample, an end-user can change the custom field value ("Priority") via the dropdown list in the appointment's context menu or edit it in a custom Edit Appointment Form.</p>
